## Configuration Parameters

- `id` (required): ESPHome component ID for automations
- `device_name` (optional): BLE device name (default: "ESP32 Mouse Jiggler")
- `manufacturer` (optional): Manufacturer name (default: "ESPHome")
- `battery_level` (optional): Battery level 0-100% (default: 100)

*Note: `mouse_id` is automatically assigned - no need to specify manually!*

## Automations

The component provides actions for controlling jiggling behavior of each mouse independently:

```yaml
# Example automations for multiple mice
automation:
  # Work mouse schedule
  - alias: "Start work mouse at 9 AM"
    trigger:
      platform: time
      at: "09:00:00"
    action:
      - ble_mouse_jiggler.start:
          id: work_mouse

  - alias: "Stop work mouse at 5 PM"
    trigger:
      platform: time
      at: "17:00:00"
    action:
      - ble_mouse_jiggler.stop:
          id: work_mouse

  # Gaming mouse schedule
  - alias: "Start gaming mouse at 6 PM"
    trigger:
      platform: time
      at: "18:00:00"
    action:
      - ble_mouse_jiggler.start:
          id: gaming_mouse

  - alias: "Stop gaming mouse at midnight"
    trigger:
      platform: time
      at: "00:00:00"
    action:
      - ble_mouse_jiggler.stop:
          id: gaming_mouse

  # Manual control
  - alias: "Emergency jiggle on button press"
    trigger:
      platform: gpio
      pin: GPIO0
      on_press:
    action:
      - ble_mouse_jiggler.jiggle_once:
          id: work_mouse
      - ble_mouse_jiggler.jiggle_once:
          id: gaming_mouse
```

## Available Actions

- `ble_mouse_jiggler.start` - Start automatic jiggling for specified mouse
- `ble_mouse_jiggler.stop` - Stop automatic jiggling for specified mouse
- `ble_mouse_jiggler.jiggle_once` - Perform single mouse movement for specified mouse

## Hardware Requirements

- **ESP32** (not ESP8266) - Required for Bluetooth support
- **ESPHome 2023.5.0+**

## Device Pairing

1. Flash the firmware to your ESP32
2. In Bluetooth settings, you'll see multiple devices (e.g., "Work Mouse Jiggler", "Gaming Mouse Jiggler")
3. Pair each device individually - they will appear as separate mice in your system
4. Each mouse can be connected to different devices or the same device
5. Components automatically start jiggling after connection

## How It Works

The component:
1. Initializes multiple virtual BLE mice on ESP32 (shared Bluetooth stack)
2. Each mouse operates independently with its own:
   - Device name and advertising
   - Connection status
   - Jiggling schedule and parameters
3. At regular intervals, each connected mouse performs subtle movement
4. Movement is very small (1-2 pixels) and immediately reversed, so cursor stays in place
5. Simulates user activity, preventing screen savers and idle timeouts

## Use Cases for Multiple Mice

- **Work + Personal** - Different schedules for work and personal computers
- **Different Applications** - Work mouse (frequent jiggling) vs Gaming mouse (rare jiggling)
- **Multiple Devices** - Connect each mouse to different computers/devices
- **Redundancy** - Backup mice in case one disconnects
- **Specialized Settings** - Different jiggle patterns for different purposes

## Technical Implementation

- Uses enhanced ESP32 BLE stack with multiple GATT applications
- Automatically downloads required dependencies via PlatformIO
- Clean, minimal codebase with multi-instance architecture
- Full ESPHome component integration with independent automation support
- Static Bluetooth management for efficient resource usage

## Limitations

- **ESP32 BLE connections limit**: Typically 3-4 simultaneous connections
- **Memory usage**: Each mouse instance uses additional RAM
- **Advertising conflicts**: All mice advertise simultaneously (managed automatically)

## Safety Notice

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Use responsibly and in accordance with your company's policies. This component is intended for personal use.

## Troubleshooting

### Multiple mice not appearing
- Ensure different `device_name` for each mouse
- Check ESP32 memory usage in logs
- Verify Bluetooth is enabled on target devices

### Connection issues
- Try pairing one mouse at a time
- Clear Bluetooth cache on target device
- Check ESP32 logs for connection events

### Jiggling not working
- Verify mouse is connected (check logs)
- Ensure jiggling is enabled for specific mouse ID
- Check automation triggers and actions
